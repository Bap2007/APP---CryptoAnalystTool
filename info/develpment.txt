CryptoAnalyst Tool


Description:
This python console app has for goal to help decrypt different encrypted
messages, using different method of decryptage, the cryptoanalyst will have
to type the message in the app, then choose among the different methods
that he think were possibly used to encrypt the message.

Outpout:
list of every decryptage possibilities, the cryptoanalyst will have to search the one
which make sens. (A further goal of this app would be to create an neuronal
network trained to detect messages which make sens in english or french among
the long list of possibilities)

Features:
1. input the encrypted message
2. select a decryptage algortithm
3. apply the algorithm to the message
4. display all the possibilities
5. try another algorithm to the message until the correct answer is found


Algorithms:
Caesar Cipher     affine encryption       permutation      Vigen√®re's key
